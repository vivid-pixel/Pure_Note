# Pure Note
is a minimal notepad application for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It's not an attempt to create a super-enhanced text editor like *Notepad++* for Windows or *gedit* for Linux, but that doesn't mean I won't have fun coding new features in time. As of 2022/10/11 I'm happy to say the program is usable enough to have earned its first version number (0.9), as well as its first Windows executable. TODO: Roadmap for 1.0

# A note about PureBasic
If you've never heard of it, [PureBasic](https://www.purebasic.com/) is simplistic and powerful like Python and Ruby, while bringing the benefits of the C language: Compiled, native binaries that are fast and compact for any platform. While it's technically paid software, you can use the free version with very few limitations. There is a Web-focused variant called SpiderBasic. I am not sponsored, I assure you! I just think PureBasic is nifty.
