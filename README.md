# Pure Note
is a minimal notepad application for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Linux ARM (Raspberry Pi). It's not an attempt to create a super-enhanced text editor like Notepad++ for Windows or gedit for Linux, but that doesn't mean I won't have fun coding new features in time.

For those who don't know of PureBasic, it's quick-to-develop like Python or Ruby, while bringing the benefits of a language like C: Compiled, native binaries that are fast and compact.
